1.  Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

    Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

    1.  Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name.

    1.  Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
    1.  Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

1.  If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a pint.

1.  Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a [bug report](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/arc-applescript-api/issues).

1.  If you use code, calling it your own would make you a ROYAL dick. [How to cite a repo](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/14010/how-do-you-cite-a-github-repository). Alternatively, even just a comment giving attribution to where you found the code would be OK.
